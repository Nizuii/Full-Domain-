# What is Flask?

Flask is a python micro web back end framework. In translation we could say:

- Flask does not force rule on us.
- We decide the folder structure.
- We decide how authentication works.
- It is lightweight, fast, perfet for learning backend fundamentals.

## Setting up Flask

### 1️⃣ Setup our project folder

```bash
mkdir project_name
cd project_name
```

Now we need to setup virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2️⃣ Install Flask

```bash
pip install flask
```

### 3️⃣ Creating our first flask app (The foundation brick)

create a file called `app.py`
